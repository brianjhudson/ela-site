# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Next.js 15 project named "sentence-parser" bootstrapped with `create-next-app`. It uses the App Router architecture with TypeScript and React 19.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack (opens on http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm start` - Start the production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

## TypeScript Configuration

The project uses strict TypeScript settings with:

- Target: ES2017
- Module resolution: bundler
- Path aliases configured for `@/*` imports
- Next.js plugin enabled for enhanced TypeScript support

## Core Development Philosophy

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

### Design Principles

- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function, class, and module should have one clear purpose.
- **Fail Fast**: Check for potential errors early and raise exceptions immediately when issues occur.

## 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity

### File and Function Limits

- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code**. If approaching this limit, refactor by splitting into modules.
- **Functions should be under 50 lines** with a single, clear responsibility.
- **Classes should be under 100 lines** and represent a single concept or entity.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Line lenght should be max 100 characters**

### Project Architecture

Follow strict vertical slice architecture with tests living next to the code they test:

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **Styling**: CSS Modules (see `app/page.module.css`)
- **Fonts**: Geist and Geist Mono from Google Fonts
- **Path Aliases**: `@/*` maps to the root directory

#### Key Files and Structure

- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with font configuration and metadata
- `app/page.tsx` - Home page component using CSS Modules
- `app/globals.css` - Global styles
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with path aliases
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint configuration extending Next.js rules

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

1. **Write the test first** - Define expected behavior before implementation
2. **Watch it fail** - Ensure the test actually tests something
3. **Write minimal code** - Just enough to make the test pass
4. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green
5. **Repeat** - One test at a time

### Test Organization

- Unit tests: Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- Integration tests: Test component interactions
- End-to-end tests: Test complete user workflows
- Keep test files next to the code they test
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage, but focus on critical paths

## 🔄 Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/*` - Code refactoring
- `test/*` - Test additions or fixes

### Commit Message Format

Never include claude code, or written by claude code in commit messages

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

Example:
```

feat(auth): add two-factor authentication

- Implement TOTP generation and validation
- Add QR code generation for authenticator apps
- Update user model with 2FA fields

Closes #123

````

## 📝 Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

- Every module should have a docstring explaining its purpose
- Public functions must have complete docstrings
- Complex logic should have inline comments with `# Reason:` prefix
- Keep README.md updated with setup instructions and examples
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md for version history

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Optimization Guidelines

- Profile before optimizing - use `cProfile` or `py-spy`
- Use `lru_cache` for expensive computations
- Prefer generators for large datasets
- Use `asyncio` for I/O-bound operations
- Consider `multiprocessing` for CPU-bound tasks
- Cache database queries appropriately

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Security Guidelines

- Never commit secrets - use environment variables
- Validate all user input with Pydantic
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement rate limiting for APIs
- Keep dependencies updated with `uv`
- Use HTTPS for all external communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **NEVER ASSUME OR GUESS** - When in doubt, ask for clarification
- **Always verify file paths and module names** before use
- **Keep CLAUDE.md updated** when adding new patterns or dependencies
- **Test your code** - No feature is complete without tests
- **Document your decisions** - Future developers (including yourself) will thank you

## 🔍 Search Command Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Always use `rg` (ripgrep) instead of traditional `grep` and `find` commands:

```bash
# ❌ Don't use grep
grep -r "pattern" .

# ✅ Use rg instead
rg "pattern"

# ❌ Don't use find with name
find . -name "*.py"

# ✅ Use rg with file filtering
rg --files | rg "\.py$"
# or
rg --files -g "*.py"
````

**Enforcement Rules:**

```
(
    r"^grep\b(?!.*\|)",
    "Use 'rg' (ripgrep) instead of 'grep' for better performance and features",
),
(
    r"^find\s+\S+\s+-name\b",
    "Use 'rg --files | rg pattern' or 'rg --files -g pattern' instead of 'find -name' for better performance",
),
```

## 🚀 GitHub Flow Workflow Summary

main (protected) ←── PR ←── feature/your-feature
↓ ↑
deploy development

### Daily Workflow:

1. git checkout main && git pull origin main
2. git checkout -b feature/new-feature
3. Make changes + tests
4. git push origin feature/new-feature
5. Create PR → Review → Merge to main
